# IFWASTE

My version 0 used to start create the IFWASTE model at the ABE Department of UF under Dr. Ziynet Boz and Dr. Gregory Kiker funded by the USDA. Goal was to use the Theory of Planned Behavior inside of an Agent-Based Model to track Food Waste in a simulated community.

## Assumptions

- Ppl shop randomly
- Ppl cook with random items
- Ppl cook everyday
- Ppl shop every so many days
- Only food cooked at home or store are eaten aka no snacks and only one meal is eaten which reaches calorie need
- Food data like price, weight, kcal. etc. from quick google searches not backed
